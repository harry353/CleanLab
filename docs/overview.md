# CleanLab Overview

CleanLab is a modular Python framework for exploring and testing deconvolution algorithms used in radio interferometric imaging. It builds upon the existing CLEAN algorithm with several strategies, including sub-pixel precision, multi-peak, and cluster-based approaches.

## Key Features
- Multiple CLEAN modes (Clark, Sinc, Cluster, Multi)
- Spectral cube CLEAN support
- Interactive or automatic masking
- Flexible gain functions
- Easy CLI usage

CleanLab is designed as both a **research sandbox**, in order to better understand how traditional CLEAN algorithms work, as well as to design "pathfinder" algorithms in an easily modifiable and extendable environment.
